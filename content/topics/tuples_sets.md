# Tuples & Sets

## Objective

Learn the properties of tuples and sets, which are special subsets of lists.

## Tuples

Tuples are a special subset of lists. Tuples are *immutable* in that they cannot be changed after creation. Tuples are denoted with `()` as opposed to `[]`.

Similar to lists, you can declare tuples with `tuple()` or just `()`. Again, the former can only take one argument, but is useful when you're creating a tuple from an existing list.

```python
x = ['Taq', 100]
score1 = tuple(x)
print(score1) # ('Taq', 100) 

# OR

score2 = ('Randy', 101) # ('Randy', 101)
print(score2)
```
There is also a third way to create a tuple... simply place a comma between two separate values.

```python
score3 = 'Eliza', 102
print(score3) # ('Eliza', 102)
```

We read tuples just like we would read a list:

```python
dna = ('A', 'T'), ('G', 'C')
print(dna) # (('A', 'T'), ('G', 'C'))


print(dna[0]) # ('A', 'T')
print(dna[1][0]) # G
```

You can do SOME operations as long as those operations would not attempt to change the tuple. Since the tuple is immutable, that will throw an error. 

```python
tuple1 = (1, 4, 3, 7, 5, 4, 2, 6)

print(f'''
Length: {len(tuple1)}
Sum: {sum(tuple1)}
Min: {min(tuple1)}
Max: {max(tuple1)}
Occurrences of "4": {tuple1.count(4)}
Index of "2": {tuple1.index(2)}
''')
```
You can also sort, join, or split a tuple the same as a list, **BUT** because you can't edit a tuple:
* You can't use `.sort()` because that edits the object *in place*.
* Each of these will return a *new list object*

#### Sort 

```python
tuple2 = ('b', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'd')

sort_asc = sorted(tuple2)
print(sort_asc, type(sort_asc)) # ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] <class 'list'>

sort_desc = sorted(tuple2, reverse = True)
print(sort_desc, type(sort_desc)) # ['e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'] <class 'list'>
```
#### Join

```python
joined = ', '.join(tuple2) # Joined: b, e, c, a, d <class 'str'>
print('Joined:', joined, type(joined))
```
#### Split

```python
split_up = joined.split(',') # Split: ['b', ' e', ' c', ' a', ' d'] <class 'list'>
print('Split:', split_up, type(split_up))
```

## Sets

Sets are special lists in that they can only have **unique** elements. They are denoted with `{}`.

```python
set_1 = {1,2,3,4,5} # this is a set, notice the {}
set_2 = {1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,5,5} # this is still a set
print(set_2) # {1,2,3,4,5}

print(set_1 == set_2) # True
```
Sets are NOT indexed, so you cannot access, say, the 3rd element in a set. Instead, you can use *boolean membership operators* to check for a value's existence in the set. Remember those?

```python
set_1 = {1,2,3,4,5}

print(2 in set_1) # True
print(8 in set_1) # False

print(2 and 8 in set_1) # False
print(2 and 3 in set_1) # True
```

That said, you can still perform mathmetical operations on sets. These are the same examples we used for tuples, and they have the same results... EXCEPT you can't find the index of an element for the reasons we just discussed! And as such, you can't count the number of occurrences of an item in a set.

```python
set1 = (1, 4, 3, 7, 5, 4, 2, 6)

print(f'''
Length: {len(set1)}
Sum: {sum(set1)}
Min: {min(set1)}
Max: {max(set1)}
set1.count(4) won't work
set1.index(2) won't work
''')
```

You *can also sort, join, or split* a set, **BUT** you have the same limitations as you do with a tuple:
* You can't use `.sort()` because that edits the object in place
* Each of these will return a *new list object*

#### Sort

```python
set2 = {'b', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'd'}

sort_asc = sorted(set2)
print(sort_asc, type(sort_asc)) # ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] <class 'list'>

sort_desc = sorted(set2, reverse = True)
print(sort_desc, type(sort_desc)) # ['e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'] <class 'list'>
```
#### Join

```python
joined = ', '.join(set2) # Joined: b, e, c, a, d <class 'str'>
print('Joined:', joined, type(joined))
```
#### Split

```python
split_up = joined.split(',') # Split: ['b', ' e', ' c', ' a', ' d'] <class 'list'>
print('Split:', split_up, type(split_up))
```
>**Pro Tip!**
>Sets give a great way to remove duplicates from a list!

```python
my_list = [1,2,4,5,2,3,1,4,5,1,5,3]

uniques_in_my_list = set(my_list)
print(uniques_in_my_list) # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

my_list = list(uniques_in_my_list)
print(my_list) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
