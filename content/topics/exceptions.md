## Key Takeaways

* Python has many built-in errors. Some of the **most** common are keep in mind are TypeErrors, ValueErrors, KeyErrors, IndexErrors, AttributeErrors, and SyntaxErrors.
* Use `try`/`except` syntax to catch an expected error.
* Logic issues don't throw errors, so be careful!

* To get very advanced, include [unit tests](http://www.diveintopython.net/unit_testing/index.html)
* The [pytest module](http://pythontesting.net/framework/pytest/pytest-introduction/) is great for unit testing.
