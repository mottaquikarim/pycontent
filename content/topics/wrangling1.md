# Data Wrangling I - 👷‍♀️🚧 UNDER CONSTRUCTION 🚧👷‍♀️

Over the next few lessons, we will use Pandas to wrangle, clean, explore, analyze, and visualize data. We know that the data science lifecycle is NOT made of discrete, linear steps. As such, we will not review one-off examples of each function or attribute. Instead, we will walk through the analysis of a dataset together. We will integrate Pandas examples based on how and when we need to use them.

This might get a little confusing, so brace yourself! Ultimately though, this approach will help you apply the material on your own much more easily. To help keep things as consistent as possible, we'll use the same dataset across units. We also created a **[categorized cheat sheet of common Pandas functions](../resources/pandas_cheat_sheet.md)**.
