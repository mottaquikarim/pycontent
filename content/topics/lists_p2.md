# Lists: Part 2

## Objectives







#### Join Items

If you need to, you can compile your list items into a single string using `.join()`. You CANNOT do this with lists of numbers, booleans, or a list containing a mix of strings and other data types though.

```python
letters = ['j', 'u', 'l', 'i', 'a', 'n', 'n', 'a']
name = ''.join(letters)
print(name) # 'julianna'

words = ['this', 'is', 'fun']
sentence = ' '.join(words)
print(f'{sentence}.') # 'this is fun.'
```

#### Split Items

Conversely, you can separate a string using `.split('by_char')`, which will parse values out of a string and turn each value into a list item. This one doesn't work for single words you might want to split into individual characters. That said, you *can* specify what character should convey to the method when to split out a new item. By default, `.split('by_char')` will use a space character to split the string.

```python
x = 'this is fun'
sentence = x.split() # note - using default split char at space
print(sentence) # ['this', 'is', 'fun']

y = 'Sandra,hi@email.com,646-212-1234,8 Cherry Lane,Splitsville,FL,58028'
data = y.split(',')
print(data) # ['Sandra', 'hi@email.com', '646-212-1234', '8 Cherry Lane', 'Splitsville', 'FL', '58028']
```

## Built-in Operators for Analyzing Lists

Python has some built-in operations that allow you to analyze the content of a list. Some basic ones include:

**`sum()`**: returns the sum of all items in *numerical lists*.

```python
team_batting_avgs = [.328, .299, .208, .301, .275, .226, .253, .232, .287]
sum_avgs = sum(team_batting_avgs)
print(f'The total of all the batting averages is {sum_avgs}.')
```
**`min()`** & **`max()`**: return the smallest or largest number *in a numerical list*.

```python
team_batting_avgs = [.299, .208, .301, .275, .328, .226, .253, .232, .287]

print(f'Highest: {max(team_batting_avgs)}') # .328
print(f'Lowest: {min(team_batting_avgs)}') # .208
```

#### `.index()`

Given a list element's value, return its index.

```python
sentence = ['a', 'purple', 'pig', 'and', 'a', 'green', 'donkey', 'flew', 'a', 'kite', 'in', 'the', 'middle','of', 'the', 'night', 'and', 'ended', 'up', 'sunburnt']

pig_index = sentence.index('pig')
print(pig_index)
```

If the element occurs multiple times in the list, `.index()` will only return the index of its *first* occurrence!

```python
sentence = ['a', 'purple', 'pig', 'AND', 'a', 'green', 'donkey', 'flew', 'a', 'kite', 'in', 'the', 'middle','of', 'the', 'night', 'AND', 'ended', 'up', 'sunburnt']

and_index = sentence.index('AND')
print(and_index) # 3
```

#### `.count()`

This returns the number of occurrences of a *single, distinct element* within a list. That means for example, if you're searching a list of words (i.e. strings) for the occurrences of a single letter, only instances where that single letter appears as its own list item will be counted.

```python
nums = [84, 8, 18, 8, 28, 6, 10, 8, 78, 9]
print(nums.count(8)) # 3


sentence = ['a', 'purple', 'pig', 'and', 'a', 'green', 'donkey', 'flew', 'a', 'kite', 'in', 'the', 'middle','of', 'the', 'night', 'and', 'ended', 'up', 'sunburnt']
print(sentence.count('a')) # 3
```

If you want to count the occurrences of a single character within a larger value, you can still use `.count()`...

```python
word = 'sunburnt'
print(word.count('u')) # 2
```

>>**GOTCHA!**
>>`.count()` throws an error if you try to count the number of times the digit "2" appears in the number below. And remember, you CANNOT use the `.split()` method as a workaround because `.split()` only works on strings!

```python
num = 22384232348
print(num.count(2))
```

#### Practice Together!

Now, take a look at how these list operations work together in this contextual example. Let's say we're conducting a probability experiment with coin tosses. We conduct some number of trials (i.e. the coin tosses) and record the outcomes. Based on the sample below, here's one way to find the probabilities of a "Heads" or "Tails" outcome.

```python
coin_toss = [True, False, False, False, True, False, True, True, False, False, True, True, False, True]

```

## Sorting Lists

If you want to organize your lists better, you can sort them with the `.sort()` or `sorted()` functions. You can sort:

* Numbers: ascending and descending order
* Strings: alphabetically and reverse alphabetically
* You **cannot** sort a list that includes different data types. 

>**GOTCHA!**
>It's important to remember that the `.sort()` method modifies the list *in place*, while the `sorted()` function requires you to assign its result back to the variable.

#### `.sort()`

The first two examples below illustrate how to sort lists in ascending order/alphabetically using `.sort()`.

```python
numbers = [1, 3, 7, 5, 2, 4, 6]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]


letters = ['b', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'd']
letters.sort()
print(letters) # ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```

To do this in descending order, simply add `reverse=True` as an argument in `.sort()` like this:

```python
numbers = [1, 3, 7, 5, 2, 4, 6]
numbers.sort(reverse = True)
print(numbers) # [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

letters = ['b', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'd']
letters.sort(reverse = True)
print(letters) # ['e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a']
```

#### `sorted()`

The first two examples below illustrate how to sort lists in **ascending order**/alphabetically using `sorted()`.

```python
numbers = [1, 3, 7, 5, 2, 4, 6]
ascending = sorted(numbers)
print(ascending) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]


letters = ['b', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'd']
ascending = sorted(letters)
print(ascending) # ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```

To do this in **descending order**, simply add `reverse=True` as an argument in `sorted()` like this:

```python
numbers = [1, 3, 7, 5, 2, 4, 6]
descending = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)
print(descending) # [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]


letters = ['b', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'd']
descending = sorted(letters, reverse=True)
print(descending) # ['e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a']
```

## Tuples

Tuples are a special subset of lists. They are *immutable* in that they cannot be changed after creation. Tuples are denoted with `()` as opposed to `[]`.

Similar to lists, you can declare tuples with `tuple()` or just `()`. Again, the former can only take one argument, but is useful when you're creating a tuple from an existing list.

```python
x = ['Taq', 100]
score1 = tuple(x)
print(score1) # ('Taq', 100) 

# OR

score2 = ('Randy', 101) # ('Randy', 101)
print(score2)
```
There is also a third way to create a tuple... simply place a comma between two separate values.

```python
score3 = 'Eliza', 102
print(score3) # ('Eliza', 102)
```

We read tuples just like we would read a list:

```python
dna = ('A', 'T'), ('G', 'C')
print(dna) # (('A', 'T'), ('G', 'C'))


print(dna[0]) # ('A', 'T')
print(dna[1][0]) # G
```

You can do SOME operations as long as those operations would not attempt to change the tuple. Since the tuple is immutable, that will throw an error. 

```python
tuple1 = (1, 4, 3, 7, 5, 4, 2, 6)

print(f'''
Length: {len(tuple1)}
Sum: {sum(tuple1)}
Min: {min(tuple1)}
Max: {max(tuple1)}
Occurrences of "4": {tuple1.count(4)}
Index of "2": {tuple1.index(2)}
''')
```
You can also sort, join, or split a tuple the same as a list, **BUT** because you can't edit a tuple:
* You can't use `.sort()` because that edits the object *in place*.
* Each of these will return a *new list object*

#### Sort 

```python
tuple2 = ('b', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'd')

sort_asc = sorted(tuple2)
print(sort_asc, type(sort_asc)) # ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] <class 'list'>

sort_desc = sorted(tuple2, reverse = True)
print(sort_desc, type(sort_desc)) # ['e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'] <class 'list'>
```
#### Join

```python
joined = ', '.join(tuple2) # Joined: b, e, c, a, d <class 'str'>
print('Joined:', joined, type(joined))
```
#### Split

```python
split_up = joined.split(',') # Split: ['b', ' e', ' c', ' a', ' d'] <class 'list'>
print('Split:', split_up, type(split_up))
```

## Sets

Sets are special lists in that they can only have **unique** elements. They are denoted with `{}`.

```python
set_1 = {1,2,3,4,5} # this is a set, notice the {}
set_2 = {1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,5,5} # this is still a set
print(set_2) # {1,2,3,4,5}

print(set_1 == set_2) # True
```
Sets are NOT indexed, so you cannot access, say, the 3rd element in a set. Instead, you can use *boolean membership operators* to check for a value's existence in the set. Remember those?

```python
set_1 = {1,2,3,4,5}

print(2 in set_1) # True
print(8 in set_1) # False

print(2 and 8 in set_1) # False
print(2 and 3 in set_1) # True
```

That said, you can still perform mathmetical operations on sets. These are the same examples we used for tuples, and they have the same results... EXCEPT you can't find the index of an element for the reasons we just discussed! And as such, you can't count the number of occurrences of an item in a set.

```python
set1 = (1, 4, 3, 7, 5, 4, 2, 6)

print(f'''
Length: {len(set1)}
Sum: {sum(set1)}
Min: {min(set1)}
Max: {max(set1)}
set1.count(4) won't work
set1.index(2) won't work
''')
```

You *can also sort, join, or split* a set, **BUT** you have the same limitations as you do with a tuple:
* You can't use `.sort()` because that edits the object in place
* Each of these will return a *new list object*

#### Sort

```python
set2 = {'b', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'd'}

sort_asc = sorted(set2)
print(sort_asc, type(sort_asc)) # ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] <class 'list'>

sort_desc = sorted(set2, reverse = True)
print(sort_desc, type(sort_desc)) # ['e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'] <class 'list'>
```
#### Join

```python
joined = ', '.join(set2) # Joined: b, e, c, a, d <class 'str'>
print('Joined:', joined, type(joined))
```
#### Split

```python
split_up = joined.split(',') # Split: ['b', ' e', ' c', ' a', ' d'] <class 'list'>
print('Split:', split_up, type(split_up))
```
>**Pro Tip!**
>Sets give a great way to remove duplicates from a list!

```python
my_list = [1,2,4,5,2,3,1,4,5,1,5,3]

uniques_in_my_list = set(my_list)
print(uniques_in_my_list) # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

my_list = list(uniques_in_my_list)
print(my_list) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
