# Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

### Objectives

>>* Matplotlib and the building blocks of data visualizations
* Seaborn plotting fundamentals and styles
* Which visualizations to use in different scenarios
* Example code for common charts and diagrams

### Review 

Below is a brief review of the key points about data visualization & storytelling from the "Data Science Foundations" section.

* Visualizations serve to quickly explain features and conclusions about data to your stakeholders.
* As such, they should be *simple*, *uncluttered*, and *clearly labeled*. Less is more.
* Visual considerations include position, color, order, & size.
* The best visualizations tell a story about the data by illustrating key points supporting your thesis and conclusions.
* Most importantly, *consider your audience* when crafting your story.
* The chart type you select should accurately represent the variables you are pulling from data in a way that is clearly readable for your audience.
