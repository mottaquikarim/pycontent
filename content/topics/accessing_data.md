# Accessing Data

## **Core Objectives**

You can't analyze your data unless you understand how to select exactly which pieces of data you want. This lesson focuses on how to:

* Load and save data to and from your notebook
* Access a summary or a preview of the dataset
* Reference data using index positions vs. index labels
* Select single values and subsets of a Series
* Select a single column, row, or cell in a dataframe
* Select a slice of rows or columns in a dataframe
* Select a chunk of a dataframe

Over the next several lessons, we're going to use a dataset containing movie metadata that we pulled from the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). In this section, we'll use a subset of that data for simplicity's sake. This subset will include three fields: imdbID, Title, and Year.

## Reading & Writing Data

Before we can even load this data, we have to import the necessary libraries.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```
Reading and writing data to and from your notebook primarily relies on the format and location of your data. The general syntax is:

* **Read:** `pd.read_<format>(<path>)`
* **Write:** `obj.to_<format>(<path>)` (`obj` is the var name of the object you're saving)

*Notice how saving your data uses obj.to_<format> and NOT obj.write_.* For the syntax of how to load the most common data types, you can reference the "Reading & Writing Data" section of our [Pandas Cheat Sheet](https://mottaquikarim.github.io/PYTH225/#out/resources/pandas_cheat_sheet).

There are a number of **optional parameters** you might want or need to use. A quick exaplanation of the most useful ones are:

* `sep`: By default, ','
You can specify the character that delimits the values so that Pandas can recognize it.
* `header`: By default, Pandas infers the headers.
If you know there is no header row, you should pass `False` and pass a list of column names to the `names` parameter.
* `names`: (see "header" above)
* `index_col`: By default, `None` and Pandas will use a 0-based numerical index for the `Index` labels. If you want to use one (or more) of the columns as the index for axis 0 (the rows), specify them here.
* `usecols`: If you want only a subset of columns loaded, indicate which ones here.
* `nrows`: By default, Pandas loads the full file. If you want only a subset of the data, you can specify a number of rows to load.

#### Loading the OMDb Dataset

Since this is our first time looking at it, let's load the OMDb dataset as is. 

```python
omdb_orig = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mottaquikarim/pycontent/master/content/raw_data/omdb_subset.csv')
movies = omdb_orig.copy()
```

It's also a helpful practice to immediately make a hard copy of the dataset so that, at any time, you can compare your data to the original dataset. You can make a shallow copy (see below), but it's always better to make a hard copy with the `.copy()` method.

>> Warning! [SettingWithCopyWarning](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/settingwithcopywarning/)

## Summary Data & Metadata

Typically, the first thing you'll want to do is use the `.info()` method to see a summary of the data in your dataframe. This will tell you things like how many rows there are, what datatype each column Series contains, and how many non-null values are in each column. Note that Series objects do NOT have this attribute.

```python
movies.info()
```
Sometimes you'll want to grab some of this information individually though. To return all the column names, you can use `.columns`... 

```python
movies.columns
```

...and `len(df)` returns the number of rows in a dataframe. For a Series, `len(series)` gives the number of items in the array. Similarly, `.size` and `.shape` give the number of elements in the object and the dimensions of the object. Check these out:

```python
print(
'Length:', len(movies), 
'\nSize:', movies.size, 
'\nShape:', movies.shape
)
```

By now, you'll probably want to preview the data itself. `.head(n)` and `.tail(n)` will return the first and last *n* rows of data respectively. If you don't pass in a number, they will both return 5 rows by default. You can use `.head()` and `.tail()` on Series objects as well.

```python
movies.head() 
```

```python
movies.tail(3) 
```

Now, it would be very intuitive for us to use the `Title` column for index labels, but you can easily see that it's not unique:

```python
movies['Title'].is_unique
```

The `imdbID` column is though. Especially because IMDb is the most well-known movie database, we should use `imdbID` as the index. That way we can access each movie via its imdbID label.

```python
print('Is imdbID unique?', movies['imdbID'].is_unique)

movies.set_index(['imdbID'], drop=True, inplace=True)
movies.head(3)
```

By default, the `drop` parameter in the `.set_index()` function is `True`. As you can see above, `imdbID` no longer exists as a column in the dataframe. It has been converted into an `Index` object.

>>**NOTE!** If we wanted, we could have set `imdbID` as the index upon loading the files by passing `index_col='imdbID'` to our `pd.read_csv()` function.

```python
imdbID = movies.index
type(imdbID)
```

If you ever want to go back to the default numerical `Index` labels, you can use `.reset_index()`. It will simply add the custom `Index` object back to the dataframe as a column Series.

```python
movies.reset_index(inplace=True)
movies.tail()
```

Now, let's set the index back to `imdbID`.

```python
movies.set_index(['imdbID'], inplace=True)
```

## Selecting Data

Dataframe columns are the easiest and most flexible pieces of data to select and maneuver.

Return a single column as a Series:

```python
print(type(movies['Title']), '\n')
titles = movies['Title']
titles
```

Return a subset of columns (in any order) as a new DataFrame:

```python
movies[['Title']] # NOT a Series object, but a one column Series
```

For most other pieces of data that you want to select, you will use some variation of `.loc[]` or `.iloc[]`. It's vital to understand the difference between these two functions: 

* **`.loc[]`** selects and returns data by passing index **LABELS** as arguments; ranges are *inclusive* (i.e. .loc[0:10] will select rows 0 to 10)
* **`.iloc[]`** selects and returns data by passing index **POSITIONS** as arguments; ranges are *exclusive* (i.e. .iloc[0:10] will select rows 0 to 9)

### **Single Value in a Series**

Select a single value in a Series by its index label

```python
titles.loc['tt1302006']
```

Select a single value in a Series by its index position

```python
titles.iloc[516]
```

### **Single Row**

Select a single row by its label

```python
movies.loc['tt0088763']
```

Select a single row by its index position

```python
movies.iloc[112]
```

### **Single DataFrame Cell**

**Select a single cell in a DataFrame by row & column labels**

>>movies['Title'][:5]

```python
movies.loc['tt0088763', 'Year']
```

Select a single cell in a DataFrame by row & column index positions

```python
movies.iloc[112, 0]
```

### **Subset of a Series**

Returns a subset of a Series by entering a range of labels

```python
titles.loc['tt1302006':'tt1025100']
```

Returns a subset of a Series by entering a range of index positions

```python
titles.iloc[4870:4875]
```

### **Slice of Rows**

Returns a *slice* of rows as a new DataFrame by entering a range of labels

```python
movies.loc['tt1302006':'tt1025100']
```

Returns a *slice* of rows as a new DataFrame by entering a range of index positions

```python
movies.iloc[4870:4875]
```

Returns a *slice* of rows as a new DataFrame by entering an unordered group of labels (also works with `.iloc()` and a list of index positions).

```python
labels = ['tt1302006', 'tt0088763', 'tt1025100', 'tt1396484', 'tt4972582']
movies.loc[labels]
```

### **Chunk of a Dataframe**

Select a chunk of a DataFrame by entering a range of row and column labels

```python
movies.loc['tt4972582':'tt1396484','Title':'Year']
```

Select a slice of a DataFrame by entering a range of row and column index positions

```python
movies.iloc[4870:4875,0:1]
```
