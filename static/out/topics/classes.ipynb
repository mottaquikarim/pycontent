That means, whether we explicitly see it or not, every parent class is also the child class of its own parent class!\n",

Imagine you want to expand on an instance of `Animal` called `elephants`. In order to document information about each elephant at the zoo, you might create an `Elephant` class that inherits from your `Animal` class. To do so, you use this general syntax:\n"

Parent class instances still adhere to the original parent class specs. For example:\n"
