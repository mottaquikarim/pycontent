    "A data type is a unit of information that can be stored and retrieved using a program language. **Variables** store different types of data. You can display the value stored in a variable on the screen using the `print()` statement. Because variables are so ubiquitous, there are some **rules for naming variables** that help avoid confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rule:** snake_case with the underscore character\n",
    "- **Rule:** Can‚Äôt use keywords as var names, e.g. True, None, function, class, object\n",
    "- **Rule:** Can‚Äôt start with a numeric value, e.g. can't name something \"1var\", but you CAN do function1\n",
    "- **Best Practice:** You COULD use CamelCase to name a variable, but this is typically reserved for naming a different Python object called a \"class\".\n",

One way to do this is adding `\\n` to signify that you want to create a new line. However, there's another way to do this that makes it much more readable! To do this, you can use triple quotes i.e. `'''` or `\"\"\"`. You can use single and double quotes within the string freely, so no need to worry about that detail!\n",
