    "At their core, **list comprehensions** are a short-cut for transforming lists into other lists. Essentially, you can iterate through my_list using a condensed for-loop syntax. Till now, we've been fine using for loops to transform lists, but as your code gets more complicated, you'll be thankful for any short-cut!\n",
