    "## The What, Why, & Who of Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether or not they realize, most people have come into contact with data science in their daily lives. We've seen trending articles on digital news outlets, personalized product recommendations from online stores, and advertisments that seemingly hear our every thought and conversation. But what exactly *is* data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### WHAT\n",
    "* Acquiring, organizing, and delivering complex data\n",
    "* Building and deploying machine learning models\n",

    "\n",
    "#### WHY\n",
    "* Identify hidden patterns, correlations, and outliers to glean meaningful insights.\n",
    "* Based on these insights, validate assumptions, make predictions, define optimizations, and most importantly make strategic decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### WHO\n",
    "Professionals who practice data science for businesses, government institutions, nonprofits, and other organizations might have one of these titles:\n",

    "\n",
    "*Image Source: http://sudeep.co/data-science/Understanding-the-Data-Science-Lifecycle/*\n",
    "\n",
    "The image above delineates the general steps you would take when you start a data science project. Of course, they're really guidelines because you have to let your results guide you. Sometimes you might skip a step, repeat certain steps, or restart the entire cycle when trying to answer a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "\n",
    "- understand your issue\n",
    "- for example... TBD\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) DATA MINING\n",
    "\n",
    "- obtain the data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) DATA CLEANING\n",
    "\n",
    "- standardize data formatting\n",
    "- remove null values or duplicates\n",
    "- remove extreme outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) DATA EXPLORATION\n",
    "\n",
    "We already looked at the columns in this dataset, but now we want to gain a deeper understanding and create some meaning to help determine our path forward. To do so, we will look at descriptive statistics, probably starting with summary statistics for the different variables in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) FEATURE ENGINEERING\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is where we transition from merely describing and summarizing the data to manipulating and analyzing it. This step always starts with the same question - *What else do you want to know about the dataset?* The answers to this usually pertain to some pre-existing assumption, ostensible relationships (or lack thereof), unexpected values, or anomalies, which you want to investigate further. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE!** It is common for this step to reinforce and revisit the prior step as we discover anomalies or intriguing relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) PREDICTIVE MODELING\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the magic happens. We won't get into the details of machine learning here. However, the model you create for any data science project will be core source of insights and conclusions. Once you have results, it's time to dig in and think outside the box! Ask yourself questions like: \n",
    "\n",
    "* How do our results compare to our initial hypothesis?\n",
    "* How statistically significant (i.e. accurate) are our predictions?\n",
    "* Do we have enough information to draw decisive conclusions? If so, what are they?\n",
    "* Based on our conclusions, what concrete actions do we recommend?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that your results might not be sufficient after only one iteration. They might point you in the right direction, but they won't necessarily answer all your questions sufficiently. You'll probably have to repeat parts of the cycle several times before you can confidently draw conclusions and make recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7) DATA VISUALIZATION (& Data Storytelling)\n",
    "\n",
    "The single most important takeaway from this walk-through is this - *the value of your results depends directly on how well key stakeholders understand them!* Data science is valuable because of the insights we can discover using it. You can have all the mathematical evidence in the world for those insights, but your stakeholders have to understand their contextual significance and believe they can turn them into strategic, impactful business actions. Otherwise, what value do those insights have?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a data scientist might not present results to clients or high-level managers, but you *do* need to be able to explain results to team members who are not expert data scientists. \n",
    "\n",
    "This where the ubiquitous buzz phrase **data storytelling** comes into play. The goal of data storytelling is to convey your message in a way that provokes thoughts and ideas, inspires questions, encourages conversation and brainstorming, and ultimately, ignites action. All this boils down to two core pillars:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Honing a cohesive narrative that establishes a thesis\n",
    "2. Highlighting meaningful key metrics as evidence to support that thesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Data vizualization is key to this endeavor because it's the easiest way to boil down heaps and mounds of numerical data into a clear message. That As the saying goes, a picture can say a thousand words!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips for Quality Data Viz\n",
    "\n",
    "* Focus the message on a central theme. Ensure Your visualizations should aid the progression of your message appropriately.\n",
    "\t* Display the visualization at the appropriate point in your story.\n",
    "\t* If you have more than one visualization in view at a time, position each one contextually, according to natural reading eye movement.\n",
    "* Some attributes affect our brain more strongly. In order of focus:\n",
    "\t* Position\n",
    "\t* Color\n",
    "\t* Size\n",
    "* Do not use color for decorative or non-informational purposes. It should be used to highlight key metrics or data points that help support your message.\n",
    "* Most importantly, *avoid visual clutter like the plague!*\n",
    "\t* Eliminate the legend if it will not detract from understanding.\n",
    "\t* Where you have long, vertical x-axis labels, try flipping the chart if possible.\n",
    "\t* Remove excessive boxes or lines that separate data.\n",
    "\t* Don't graph too many variables in one chart. For instance, ten lines on one chart will be too convoluted to follow!\n",
    "\n",
    "**HOWEVER, there's always one exception!** Generally, \"less is more\" surpasses everything else in importance *except for \"consider your audience\".* You always want to minimize the amount of text on your visualization, but \"the minimum\" differs based on how much context your audience has. Ultimately, you need to make sure every viewer has enough context to be grounded in the appropriate frame of reference.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Python Tools for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand the process we'll follow, we can jump into applying it with our Python skills. First, we have to set up our environments and ensure we have all the tools we need to conduct a thorough data science analysis. We won't use all of these in this introductory class, but these are the most common across the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NumPy** for computational operations on large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices\n",
    "* **Pandas** for data structuring, manipulation, and analysis\n",
    "* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization\n",
    "* **Scikit-learn** for machine learning\n",
    "* **Scrapy** for data wrangling via web scraping\n",
    "* **Jupyter Notebooks** & **Jupyter Lab** for data science integrated development environments (IDEs)"
