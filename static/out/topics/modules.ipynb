    "# Modules & Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "When you `modularize` code, it means that you group functions and objects into specific areas of focus. We call these groups `modules` and `packages`. A `module` is a Python source file that contains pre-defined objects like variables, functions, classes, and other items we'll talk about soon. A Python `package`, sometimes used synonymously with the term `library`, is simply a collection of Python modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below can show you this hierarchy visually.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For instance, the `statsmodels` module ([here](https://www.statsmodels.org/)) contains code useful to a data scientist. The `Pyglet` library ([here](http://www.pyglet.org/)) contains code useful to game developers needing shortcuts for 3D game animation. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Modular programming` allows us to break out certain packages and modules from the standard library. This means that when you first install Python, the packages and models that have been broken out are NOT installed. If you want to use them, you have to separately import them. groups of functions and objects  such that they are not installed when you install Python. It's sort of like \"a la carte\" code, and it makes the standard library more efficient for the general public. This becomes especially valuable once you scale your programs. Who needs that extra baggage?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global vs. Local Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons Python leverages modular programming is because it helps avoid conflicts between `local` and `global` variables by creating separate `namespaces`. `Namespaces` are the place where variables are stored, and they exist on several independent levels, including **local, global, built-in, and nested namespaces**. For instance, the functions `builtin.open()` and `os.open()` are distinguished by their namespaces. Namespaces also aid readability and maintainability by making it clear which module implements a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, a variable declared outside a function has `global scope`, meaning you can access a it inside or outside functions. A variable declared within a function has `local scope`, which means you can only access it within the object you created it. If you try to access it outside that, you will get a `NameError` telling you that variable is not defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll get more into how to use and interpret local and global scope as we dive into modules and functions...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Modules & Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing modules and packages is very easy and saves you a lot of time you'd otherwise spend reinventing the wheel. Modules can even import other modules! The best practice is to place all import statements at the of your script file so you can easily see everything you've imported right at the top. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importing Modules \n",
    "Let's look at a few different way to import modules and their contents. The simplest way to import a module is to simply write `import module_name`. This will allow you to access all the contents within that module. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to easily find out exactly what is in your newly imported module, you can call the built-in function `dir()` on it. This will list all types of names: variables, modules, functions, etc. \n"
