    "# Essential Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some words and concepts that will hopefully give you a more holistic view of the more technical aspects of the industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is a Computer Program?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a set of discrete, highly logical, and explicit instructions that are parsed and executed by a computer. We call this set of human-readable instructions **source code**, or colloquially, a **computer program**. A **programming language** is a series of grammar and rules that we can define towards writing this source code. Languages are effectively different approaches towards communicating the same ideas when writing source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compilers** then take this source code and transform it into **machine code**, a representation of the source that can be executed by the computer's **central processing unit** or **CPU**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all programs are compiled though, some are **interpreted**. This is dependent on which programming language you are using! The difference is that compiled languages need a step where the source code is physically transformed into machine code. However, with an interpreted language, this additional step is **excluded** in favor of **parsing** and **executing** the source code directly when the program is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How programs are written\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages *all build on the same fundamental concepts.* When you combine these concepts in any language, you can dictate a wide variety of tasks you might want your computer program to perform. The main difference lies in **how** each language runs the program (compiled vs interpreted) and also **how** each language is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many programming languages. Way too many. But here are some of the most popular ones...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **JavaScript**: this language is interpreted.\n",
    "2. **Python**: this language is interpreted.\n",
    "3. **Java**: this language is compiled\n",
    "4. **Ruby**: this language is interpreted.\n",
    "5. **C/C++**: this language is compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, anything programmable can be programmed in each of the languages defined above. However, some languages are better suited for certain tasks above others. For example, to perform web programming on the front-end, you'll want to write JavaScript. This is because all browsers collectively support running javascript within it's environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Python\n",
    "\n",
    "*Python is simple, versatile, always improving, and popular among many reputable companies!*\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is particularly well-suited for dynamically processing large amounts of data and analyzing it. Thatâ€™s what makes it so great for data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Putting up websites.\n",
    "- Analyzing data.\n",
    "- Constructing machine learning algorithms\n",
    "- Building robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When NOT to Use Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python isn't great for everything!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mobile apps\n",
    "- Huge programs\n",
    "  - Python is interpreted - the computer reads it as it goes.\n",
    "  - Other programming languages are read in advance!\n",
    "- Sometimes too easy\n",
    "  - Easy to expect things to work that don't!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Universal Code Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Declarations**\n",
    "Typically, we can store and retrieve data in our programs by associating them with intermediary values that we call **variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expressions**\n",
    "We use expressions to evaluate stuff. For example, **`2 + 2`** is an example of an expression that will **evaluate** a value, namely 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NOTE**: Typically we can use expressions and declarations in tandem to perform complex tasks. For instance, we can reference a variable we declared in an expression to help us evaluate new values which can then be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statements & Control Flow**\n",
    "Statements will use expressions and declarations to alternate a program's **control flow**, which is essentially the order in which declarations, expressions, and other statements are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from these fundamental concepts, we also talk a lot about this idea of **algorithms**. An **algorithm** is simple a series of declarations, expressions, and statements that can be used over and over again to solve well defined problems of a certain type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms can be as **simple** as converting temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius or as **complex** as processing payment for a purchase using facial recognition software. Others example include...\n",
    "\n",
    "* Managing what content to display based on search parameters\n",
    "* Calculating the total interest paid on a mortgage based on the interest rate and # of payments since the mortgage was issued.\n",
    "* Collecting user behavior data to analyze their interests and make better recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thinking Programmatically w. Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of programming lies in the universal set of fundamental concepts outlined above. For this reason, we do not need to specify any particular programming language when discussing the functional aspects of a program. This allows us to have initial, high-level discussions about a program's intended functionality using **pseudocode**, a mix of spoken language and coding syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can write a program that converts temperature from **fahrenheit** to **celsius**. It would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Declare** F = 32;\n",
    "2. **Expression** ( **F** - 32 ) / 1.8;\n",
    "3. **Declare** C = **Evaluated** expression from **[2]**\n",
    "\n",
    "^^ This is a form of pseudocode where we define the steps a computer program &mdash; **any** &mdash; computer program can take to convert **fahrenheit** to **celsius**.\n"
